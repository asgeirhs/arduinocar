You'll notice that only files with the .ino (or .pde) extension are scanned for include files. This is by design, for simplicity for one thing and so that a library can't include another library that includes another library that includes another library. Making the sketch include all the libraries needed makes it very clear what libraries a sketch will need.

If one library were free to include another that included another, without making it explicitly obvious that this was happening, it could take many iterations of downloading libraries and head scratching getting the (sample) code to compile.
